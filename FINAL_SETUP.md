# ðŸš€ Final Setup Steps for Your Pro Plan

## Step 1: Add Your Stripe Price ID

1. **Go to your Stripe Dashboard** â†’ Products â†’ Pro Plan
2. **Copy the Price ID** (it looks like `price_1ABC123def456...`)
3. **Replace the placeholder in the code**:

Open `src/utils/stripe.ts` and replace:
```typescript
stripePriceId: 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_STRIPE_PRICE_ID',
```

With your actual price ID:
```typescript
stripePriceId: 'price_1ABC123def456...',  // Your actual price ID
```

## Step 2: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the pricing page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/pricing
   ```

3. **Click "Upgrade to Pro"** on the Pro Plan card

4. **Use the test card number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any valid expiry date (e.g., 12/34)
   - Any 3-digit CVC (e.g., 123)
   - Any valid postal code (e.g., 12345)

5. **Complete the payment** - you should be redirected to the success page

6. **Test failure flow** by clicking "Back" during checkout - you should be redirected to the failure page

## What You Now Have:

âœ… **Pro Plan Only** - Simplified to show Free and Pro plans only  
âœ… **Real Stripe Integration** - Uses your actual Stripe product  
âœ… **Success Page** - Shows payment confirmation with plan details  
âœ… **Failure Page** - Handles cancelled/failed payments gracefully  
âœ… **Proper Redirects** - No more alerts, proper page navigation  
âœ… **Test Card Support** - Easy testing with 4242 4242 4242 4242  

## Pages You Can Test:

- **Pricing**: `/pricing`
- **Success**: `/payment/success` (after successful payment)
- **Failure**: `/payment/failed` (after cancelled/failed payment)

## Next Steps:

Once testing works perfectly:
1. Switch to live Stripe keys for production
2. Update webhook endpoints
3. Add user subscription tracking to your database

The integration is now clean, simple, and production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
